## Commit messages

We follow this convention to add make the commit messages standard:

All first lines of the commit messages should fit in 50 (70 if you REALLY need it) characters, use the second line and beyond to make any further explanations.
Use the correct emoji as the first thing on the commit message followed by the mentioned starting word (e.g. :bulb: Add my awesome feature)

* When adding a new feature/component/etc: `:bulb:` :bulb: Add ...
* When fixing a bug: `:bug:` :bug: Fix...
* For documentation: `:book:` :book: Docs (for/about/etc)...
* For improvements and updates: `:arrow_up:` :arrow_up: Upgrade/Improve...
* For CI/CD matters: `:cyclone:` :cyclone: No specific words here
* For maintenance: `:wrench:` :wrench: ?
* For removing code: `:fire:` :fire: Remove...
